# Shortly web app

## :dart: About The Project ##
In this project you can find a web application created with React. 
The main purpose of it is that the user can insert the link that wants to shorten and receive a brand new shortened link that can easily copy and use. 
Everything is saved in the localStorage so the user can come back to the page and find all of his links.
This was made to complete the Start2impact final project.
